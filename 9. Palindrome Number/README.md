# Palindrome Number

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green.svg)

This is a simple algorithmic problem that checks if a given integer is a palindrome or not. A palindrome is a number that reads the same backward as forward.

Given an integer `x`, you need to write a function that returns `true` if `x` is a palindrome, and `false` otherwise.

## Examples

### Example 1:
```
Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
```

### Example 3:
```
Input: x = 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
```

## Constraints
- `-231 <= x <= 231 - 1`
